Today's goals:
1. Revisit MCP on NextJS
	1. https://x.com/microchipgnu/status/1900217910468968890
	2. We made some progress and deployed a Next app with MCP, but couldn't connect to it still
	3. Probably need to rethink the whole strategy of deploying the MCP server
		1. Not shipping Next apps with MCP but instead shipping MCP proxies for all our services
2. Introduce AIM (https://aim.tools)
	1. Couldn't really do it today
3. Vibe code an app (https://v0.dev -> Cursor)
	1. Music app idea
